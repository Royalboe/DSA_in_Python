'''
You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times. 
Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. 
Your function should have the worst-case complexity of `O(log N)`, where N is the length of the list. 
You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.
