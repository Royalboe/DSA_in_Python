# PROBLEMS

## The Method / Approach

Here's the systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

This approach is explained in detail in [Lesson 1](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/lesson/lesson-1-binary-search-linked-lists-and-complexity) of the course.

## Problem 1

'''
> Alice has some cards with numbers written on them.
> She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table.
> She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible.
> Write a function to help Bob locate the card.
'''

## Problem 2

'''
> Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order,
> find the starting and ending position of a given number.

## Problem 3

## Problem - Rotated Lists

We'll solve the following problem step-by-step:

> You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times. Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function should have the worst-case complexity of `O(log N)`, where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.
>
> Example: The list `[5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4]` was obtained by rotating the sorted list `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]` 3 times.
>
> We define "rotating a list" as removing the last element of the list and adding it before the first element. E.g. rotating the list `[3, 2, 4, 1]` produces `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
>
>"Sorted list" refers to a list where the elements are arranged in the increasing order  e.g. `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
